# ConsultEase Codebase Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the ConsultEase codebase to address UI issues, bugs, and errors.

## RECENT: Major Architecture Refactoring

### Centralized Configuration
- **Issue**: Configuration was scattered across different files (`settings.ini`, environment variables, hardcoded values).
- **Fix**: Created a unified configuration system with `config.py` loading from `config.json`, environment variables, and default values.
- **Files Modified**:
  - Created `central_system/config.py` with robust configuration loading
  - Removed `central_system/settings.ini`
  - Updated all services and controllers to use the new configuration system

### Singleton Controllers
- **Issue**: Multiple controller instances could be created, leading to state inconsistencies.
- **Fix**: Converted all controllers to follow the singleton pattern with a common `.instance()` method.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `central_system/controllers/admin_controller.py`
  - `central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py`
  - `central_system/controllers/consultation_controller.py`
  - `central_system/controllers/rfid_controller.py`
  - Created `central_system/controllers/student_controller.py`

### Database Session Management
- **Issue**: Inconsistent handling of database sessions leading to potential leaks and errors.
- **Fix**: Standardized session management with a `@db_operation_with_retry` decorator and `try/finally close_db()` blocks.
- **Files Modified**:
  - Enhanced `central_system/models/base.py` with the decorator
  - Updated all controller methods to use the standardized patterns

### RFID Service Improvements
- **Issue**: Excessive database queries for each RFID scan.
- **Fix**: Implemented an in-memory student cache that refreshes periodically.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `central_system/services/rfid_service.py`

### MQTT Service Refactoring
- **Issue**: Direct `settings.ini` access and hardcoded client ID in MQTT service.
- **Fix**: 
  - Now uses `get_config()` for all MQTT settings
  - Client ID is base_id + random suffix for uniqueness
  - Added structure for TLS configuration
- **Files Modified**:
  - `central_system/services/mqtt_service.py`

### Legacy MQTT Topic Removal
