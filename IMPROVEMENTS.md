  - Added message storage for potential retry
  - Added keep-alive timer to periodically check connection status
  - Improved disconnect method to properly clean up resources

## 3. BLE Functionality Improvements

### Issues Fixed:
- Created test script to verify BLE functionality
- Improved BLE connection detection and reporting

### New Scripts:
- `scripts/test_ble_connection.py`
  - Simulates BLE beacon for faculty desk unit
  - Simulates faculty desk unit
  - Tests MQTT communication between components
  - Verifies proper status updates

## 4. UI Transitions and Consultation Panel Improvements

### Issues Fixed:
- Enhanced UI transitions to be smoother and more reliable
- Improved platform detection for transition effects
- Added better user feedback in consultation panel
- Implemented auto-refresh for consultation history

### Files Modified:
- `central_system/utils/transitions.py`
  - Improved platform detection for transition effects
  - Enhanced fade_out_in method with cross-fade effect
  - Added slide animation for platforms that don't support opacity
  
- `central_system/views/consultation_panel.py`
  - Added auto-refresh timer for history panel
  - Improved tab change animations
  - Enhanced user feedback with success/error messages
  - Added tab highlighting for better visual cues

### New Scripts:
- `scripts/test_ui_improvements.py`
  - Tests the improved UI transitions
  - Tests the enhanced consultation panel
  - Verifies proper animation and user feedback

## 5. General Improvements

### Code Quality:
- Added more comprehensive error handling
- Improved logging throughout the application
- Enhanced code comments and documentation
- Fixed unused imports and variables

### User Experience:
- Added better visual feedback for user actions
- Improved error messages and notifications
- Enhanced UI responsiveness and animations
- Added automatic refresh for dynamic content

## How to Test the Improvements

### Testing On-Screen Keyboard:
1. Run `scripts/install_onboard.sh` to install and configure onboard
2. Start the application with `python central_system/main.py`
3. Click on any text input field to verify the keyboard appears
4. Press F5 to toggle the keyboard visibility

### Testing MQTT Communication:
1. Start the MQTT broker with `mosquitto -v`
2. Run the application with `python central_system/main.py`
3. Check the logs for successful connection to the MQTT broker
4. Verify reconnection works by temporarily stopping and restarting the broker

### Testing BLE Functionality:
1. Run `python scripts/test_ble_connection.py test` to test both beacon and desk unit
2. Verify proper status updates in the console output
3. Check that consultation requests are properly received

### Testing UI Improvements:
1. Run `python scripts/test_ui_improvements.py`
2. Test the transitions between windows
3. Test the consultation panel functionality
4. Verify smooth animations and proper user feedback
