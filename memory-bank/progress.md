# ConsultEase - Progress

## Current Status
The system has undergone extensive refactoring to enhance stability, maintainability, and overall code quality. Core architectural patterns have been standardized, including centralized configuration, singleton controllers, and robust database session management. While core functionality remains, the underlying implementation is now more robust and aligned with best practices. The immediate focus is on hardware integration testing, implementing remaining security features (MQTT TLS, admin lockout), and finalizing documentation.

### What Works / Recent Achievements
- **Core Functionality (Re-validated after refactoring)**:
    - Student login (RFID scan via `RFIDService` cache/DB, manual UID input via `RFIDController`).
    - Admin dashboard: CRUD operations for faculty and students (now via `FacultyController` and `StudentController`).
    - Basic system maintenance placeholders in Admin Dashboard (backup/restore UI shows "Not Implemented").
    - Admin Authentication with Account Lockout: `AdminController.authenticate` now fully implements database-backed account lockout.
- **Major Refactoring & Enhancement Achievements**:
    - **Centralized Configuration**: `config.py` and `config.json` are the single source of truth. `RFIDService` now uses config for VID/PID.
    - **Singleton Controllers**: All core controllers are singletons.
    - **Standardized Database Session Management**: Using `@db_operation_with_retry` and `try/finally close_db()`. `RFIDService.refresh_student_data` now correctly closes DB session.
    - **Improved `RFIDService`**: Implemented student data caching, uses `config.py` for VID/PID and other settings.
    - **Improved `MQTTService`**: Uses `config.py`, enhanced TLS configuration (e.g. `tls_version`, `tls_cert_reqs`), unique client IDs.
    - **Keyboard Management**: Consolidated into `KeyboardManager`.
    - **Security Enhancements**: Admin account lockout logic fully implemented in `AdminController` and `Admin` model.
    - **Model Enhancements**: `Admin` model lockout fields and methods confirmed. `Faculty` model `last_seen` field confirmed.
    - **View Layer Refinements**: `LoginWindow`, `DashboardWindow`, `AdminDashboardWindow` updated for new controller patterns.
    - **Consistent Logging**: Centralized logging setup. `main.py` now uses `RotatingFileHandler` from `config.py` (max_size, backup_count).
- **Previously Working Features (Assumed still functional, need re-verification post-refactor)**:
    - PyQt-based UI components (Login, Dashboard, Admin).
    - Faculty Desk Unit firmware (initial version) - verified to publish to correct MQTT topic.
    - Touch-optimized UI with consistent light theme.
    - Automatic on-screen keyboard integration (via `KeyboardManager`).
    - Fullscreen Toggle (F11).
    - Admin password hashing with bcrypt.
- **Debugging & UI Enhancements (Completed)**:
    - Resolved numerous runtime errors (NameError, AttributeError, DetachedInstanceError, RuntimeError with LoadingDialog) across controllers and views.
    - Refined `ConsultationHistoryPanel` UI: Implemented robust column sizing for the table and improved status display using styled QLabels.

### What's Left to Build / Needs Verification
- **Hardware Integration & Testing**:
    - Full integration testing with actual 13.56 MHz RFID reader (verify VID/PID in `config.json`).
    - Full integration testing with ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit (MQTT messages including TLS, display, BLE).
- **BLE Presence**: Thorough testing and refinement of BLE detection logic on ESP32.
- **Security Enhancements**:
    - **MQTT TLS Testing**: Generate/obtain certs, configure in `config.json` (including new `tls_version`, `tls_cert_reqs` if needed), and thoroughly test secure communication.
- **Configuration**: Ensure `config.json` is fully documented, especially new TLS options and logging rotation settings.
- **Documentation & Training**:
    - Finalize user guides reflecting all changes.
    - Update technical/deployment documentation (especially `config.json`, MQTT TLS, RFID VID/PID, logging rotation).
- **Deployment**: Finalize deployment scripts and procedures for Raspberry Pi, including file permissions.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.

## Known Issues
- **Configuration Dependency**: System stability is highly dependent on correct values in `config.json`. Incorrect paths or settings can lead to failures.
- **Admin Backup/Restore UI**: The UI in `AdminDashboardWindow` for database backup/restore is a placeholder ("Not Implemented") and does not perform the operations. Manual `pg_dump` or `sqlite3 .backup` is required.
- **RFID Hardware Reliability**: Automatic scanning with the 13.56 MHz reader needs verification with actual hardware and correct VID/PID in `config.json`.
- **BLE Presence Reliability**: Needs extensive testing in a real environment.
- **Virtual Keyboard**: While `KeyboardManager` attempts to pick the preferred keyboard from `config.json`, behavior might vary based on OS setup and specific keyboard installations.

## Decisions Evolution

### Initial Decisions
- Chose PyQt5, PostgreSQL, MQTT, ESP32.

### Changes & Key Refinements
- **Centralized Configuration**: Shifted from scattered settings and `settings.ini` to a unified `config.py` loading `config.json` and environment variables.
- **Singleton Controllers**: Adopted singleton pattern for `AdminController`, `FacultyController`, `ConsultationController`, `RFIDController`, and new `StudentController` for unified access and state.
- **Standardized DB Sessions**: Implemented `@db_operation_with_retry` and consistent `try/finally close_db()` for robust database interactions.
- **Service Layer Enhancements**: `RFIDService` (caching, config-driven), `MQTTService` (config-driven, TLS-ready).
- **Keyboard Management**: Consolidated into a configurable `KeyboardManager`.
- **Security**: Moved from SHA256 to bcrypt for admin passwords. Added DB fields for admin account lockout. Added TLS support structure for MQTT.
- **Code Structure**: Improved modularity by introducing `StudentController` and removing business logic from views (e.g., `StudentManagementTab`).
- **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated legacy MQTT topic handling. Made test code conditional via config flags.
- **Database Flexibility**: Retained support for SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod), configurable via `config.json`.
- **Logging**: Implemented `RotatingFileHandler` for better log management.

## Blockers and Dependencies
- Hardware availability for full integration testing (13.56 MHz reader, ESP32 units).
- Correct and complete `config.json` for target deployment environment.
- Network infrastructure stability for MQTT (especially if testing TLS over a more complex network).

## Next Immediate Tasks
1.  **Configure `config.json`**: Ensure all settings for the test/deployment environment are correct (DB, MQTT broker, RFID VID/PID, keyboard, TLS paths and options).
2.  **Hardware Integration Testing**:
    *   Test RFID reader with various cards.
    *   Test ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit communication (MQTT with TLS, BLE).
3.  **Update Documentation**: Reflect new configuration system (`config.json`), refactored components, and new features/fixes (including TLS options, logging).
4.  Prepare for User Acceptance Testing.
