## Next Steps

### Phase 4 (Low Priority Improvements):
1. Implement unit and integration testing framework
2. Add diagnostic and simulation modes
3. Enhance user interface with additional visualizations
4. Add data logging and performance monitoring
5. Implement firmware update mechanism

## Planned Testing Framework for Phase 4

The unit testing framework will be designed specifically for the ESP32 environment and will include:

### 1. Mock Objects and Dependency Injection
- Create mock implementations of hardware dependencies (WiFi, BLE, Display)
- Implement dependency injection in manager classes for testability
- Develop a mock MQTT broker for network testing

### 2. Test Harness
- Create a separate test harness application for running unit tests
- Implement test runner that can execute on both ESP32 and desktop environments
- Add support for selective test execution

### 3. Assertion Framework
- Develop assertion macros for test validation
- Add support for timing assertions for performance testing
- Implement memory usage tracking during tests

### 4. Test Coverage
- Add tests for each manager class:
  - `DisplayManager`: Text rendering, layout, memory handling
  - `NetworkManager`: Connection handling, message publishing, error recovery
  - `BLEManager`: Scan processing, presence detection, override logic
  - `ConsultationManager`: Request handling, state transitions, validation
  - `ButtonManager`: Debounce logic, event propagation
  - `PowerManager`: Mode transitions, power optimization

### 5. Simulation Mode
- Implement a simulation mode that can run without hardware
- Add support for injecting simulated events (button presses, BLE signals)
- Create visualization of system state during simulation

### 6. Continuous Integration
- Set up automated testing on code changes
- Implement regression test suite
- Add performance benchmarking

## Testing Instructions
To test the Phase 3 changes:
1. Verify that all manager classes initialize correctly
2. Test error handling in network connections with deliberately bad configurations
3. Verify power saving features by monitoring current consumption
4. Test manual override functionality for BLE presence
5. Verify consultation status transitions
6. Test button debouncing under various press patterns
7. Verify display rendering with different content lengths and types
