# ConsultEase Project Summary

## Project Overview

ConsultEase is a comprehensive student-faculty interaction system designed to streamline the consultation scheduling process in academic environments. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Central System (Raspberry Pi)**: The core management system that handles the database, user interface, and communication with Faculty Desk Units.

## Usage Scenarios

### Faculty Presence Management
1. Faculty arrives at desk
2. BLE detection identifies faculty's phone/device
3. Faculty Desk Unit updates status to "Available"
4. Central System receives availability update
5. Students can now request consultations

### Consultation Request Handling
1. Student requests consultation via Central System
2. Request is sent to Faculty Desk Unit via MQTT
3. Faculty Desk Unit displays request details
4. Faculty accepts or rejects the request
5. Response is sent back to Central System
6. Student is notified of the decision

### Manual Override
1. Faculty can manually set availability status
2. Button press toggles availability
3. Status is updated on display
4. Status change is sent to Central System
5. Students see updated availability information

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Individual tests for each manager class
- Mock objects simulate hardware dependencies
- Assertions verify correct behavior
- Memory and performance checks

### Integration Testing
