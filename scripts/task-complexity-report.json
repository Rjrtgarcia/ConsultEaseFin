    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Central System Environment and Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Central System Environment setup into logical phases including environment preparation, configuration management implementation, logging system setup, and database/MQTT configuration with specific technical requirements for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components but is fairly straightforward for experienced developers. The Python environment, project structure, and configuration systems are foundational but require careful planning. The complexity comes from setting up multiple interconnected systems (logging, database, MQTT) with proper initialization procedures."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and Models",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the database implementation into logical phases: schema design with entity relationship diagrams, model implementation with SQLAlchemy, migration system setup, and CRUD operations development. Include specific validation requirements and indexing strategies for each model.",
      "reasoning": "Database design requires careful planning to ensure all system entities and relationships are properly modeled. The complexity arises from implementing multiple related models with proper relationships, migrations, validation logic, and optimized queries. This is a critical foundation for the entire system."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop RFID Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the RFID authentication system into hardware integration, card reading service, authentication logic, and session management components. Include specific error handling requirements and security considerations for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines hardware integration with software authentication logic, increasing its complexity. Working with RFID readers requires low-level hardware communication, proper event handling, and robust error management. The authentication system is security-critical and needs careful implementation of session management."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create PyQt Base UI Framework",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the PyQt UI framework development into application shell creation, navigation system implementation, common component library development, and touch optimization. Include specific design requirements, resolution considerations, and usability factors for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "Building a UI framework requires both technical implementation and design considerations. The complexity comes from creating a responsive, touch-optimized interface with proper navigation and reusable components. This task forms the foundation for all user interfaces and must be carefully architected to support future UI development."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement MQTT Communication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MQTT system into client implementation, topic structure design, message handling, connection management, and security implementation. Include specific protocol details, error handling requirements, and performance considerations for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "The MQTT communication system is highly complex due to its distributed nature and real-time requirements. It involves network programming, security considerations (TLS), offline operation handling, and robust error recovery. This is a critical backbone for the entire system's real-time functionality."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Student Interface",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the student interface into authentication flow, faculty availability view, and consultation management components. Include specific UI requirements, user experience considerations, and real-time update mechanisms for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "The student interface builds on the existing UI framework and database models. Its moderate complexity comes from implementing the consultation workflow and integrating real-time updates. The interface needs to be intuitive while handling various states (available faculty, pending requests, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Faculty Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the faculty interface into authentication system, availability management, consultation request handling, and session history components. Include specific workflow requirements, state management considerations, and real-time update mechanisms for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "The faculty interface has higher complexity than the student interface due to additional functionality like availability management and consultation control. It requires integration with both MQTT for real-time updates and the BLE presence detection system, adding technical complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Admin Interface",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the admin interface into authentication system, user management, RFID registration, system configuration, and reporting components. Include specific security requirements, data validation considerations, and administrative workflow details for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "The admin interface is the most complex of the interfaces due to its breadth of functionality. It requires implementing user management, RFID registration, system configuration, and reporting features. Each of these areas touches critical system components and requires careful implementation with proper access controls."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Faculty Desk Unit Firmware",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ESP32 firmware development into environment setup, connectivity implementation, BLE scanning system, display management, and power optimization. Include specific hardware constraints, communication protocols, and reliability requirements for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "Embedded firmware development has inherently high complexity due to hardware constraints, power management considerations, and reliability requirements. This task involves multiple communication protocols (Wi-Fi, MQTT, BLE), physical I/O handling, and must operate reliably with minimal maintenance. The combination of these factors makes it one of the most complex tasks."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "System Integration and Testing",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration and testing process into component integration, workflow testing, performance optimization, and deployment preparation. Include specific test scenarios, performance metrics, and documentation requirements for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "System integration brings together all components and exposes complex interactions and edge cases. This task involves end-to-end testing, performance optimization, error recovery testing, and security review. The complexity is high because it requires deep understanding of all system components and their interactions, plus the ability to identify and resolve cross-component issues."
